# Defect_prediction_project
In this project, data science techniques were applied to optimize the maintenance planning for a transportation company's truck fleet, specifically focusing on the air system. The main goal was to reduce maintenance costs related to this system, which had increased significantly despite the fleet size remaining constant.
